          During this time I was introduced to research on a large scale, from the first time I read a paper, the first time I reproduced methods, the first line of experimental code I wrote, to eventually the first time I wrote my own papers and the first time my papers were accepted. This experience is one of my most precious memories.
          
          I published two papers in this period, check section Publications for details.

          This was my first study abroad experience, and it was also the first time I experienced a different way of thinking about research. Changing to a new field put me at the starting point once again, asking questions with the trouble I met, and even going so far as to make every mistake that a beginner has ever made. I am looking forward to the person I will be when I graduate years from now.
